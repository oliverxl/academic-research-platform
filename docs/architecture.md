# ResearchHub Architecture

This document outlines the architecture of the ResearchHub platform, a decentralized application for academic researchers to store, share, and access research papers and datasets.

## System Overview

ResearchHub is built using a combination of decentralized and traditional technologies:

- **Frontend**: React-based web application
- **Backend**: Sui Move smart contracts
- **Storage**: Walrus decentralized storage
- **Blockchain**: Sui Network

## Component Details

### Frontend (React)

The frontend is a React application that provides the user interface for interacting with the platform. It includes:

- **Authentication**: User registration and login
- **Research Management**: Upload, view, and manage research papers and datasets
- **Search & Discovery**: Find relevant research papers and datasets
- **Access Control**: Manage permissions for shared research
- **User Profile**: Manage user profile and preferences

### Backend (Sui Move)

The backend consists of Sui Move smart contracts that handle:

- **User Management**: User registration and authentication
- **Access Control**: Permission management for research papers and datasets
- **Storage Integration**: Integration with Walrus decentralized storage
- **Indexing**: Indexing of research papers and datasets for search and discovery

### Storage (Walrus)

Walrus provides decentralized storage for research papers and datasets. It ensures:

- **Data Integrity**: Ensures that data is not tampered with
- **Data Availability**: Ensures that data is always available
- **Data Redundancy**: Ensures that data is stored redundantly across multiple nodes

## Data Flow

1. **Upload Flow**:
   - User uploads a research paper or dataset through the frontend
   - Frontend sends the file to the Sui blockchain
   - Sui blockchain stores the file metadata and access control information
   - File is stored in Walrus decentralized storage
   - Storage reference is stored in the blockchain

2. **Access Flow**:
   - User requests access to a research paper or dataset
   - Frontend sends the request to the Sui blockchain
   - Sui blockchain verifies access permissions
   - If access is granted, the frontend retrieves the file from Walrus storage
   - File is displayed to the user

## Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: Users authenticate using their Sui wallet
- **Authorization**: Access control is managed through smart contracts
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data can be encrypted before storage
- **Audit Trail**: All actions are recorded on the blockchain for transparency

## Scalability Considerations

- **Frontend**: Can be scaled horizontally using traditional web scaling techniques
- **Backend**: Sui blockchain provides high throughput and low latency
- **Storage**: Walrus provides scalable decentralized storage with minimal replication factor
